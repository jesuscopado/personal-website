  about: |
    I build AI systems and share how they work.

    From graduating top of my class in Software Engineering to earning a Double MSc in Autonomous Systems, I’ve always been driven to turn complex ideas into real-world applications. Since then, I’ve led AI initiatives ranging from research prototypes to production-ready systems, often in startup environments where speed and creativity matter most.

    Alongside my engineering work, I run a YouTube channel where I explain and demo cutting-edge AI tools in a practical, creative way. My goal is to make AI accessible through hands-on examples, from voice agents to generative video, showing how these technologies can be applied today.

    I combine solid engineering with curiosity for design, media, and human-AI interaction. I also bring an international perspective that shapes how I approach building and collaborating.
